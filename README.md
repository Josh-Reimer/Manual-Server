## Manual_Server 
Manual Server is a simple web app built with python3 flask and pure javascript for managing all your pdf manuals.
## What makes this app different 
What makes this app different than all the gazillions of other self-hosted apps? It doesn't use a database! It uses the file system entirely! This is partially because I am unfamiliar with databases and also I wanted to be able to easily run this anywhere.


## Setup
Depending on your system, you may need to create a python virtual environment first. Also note, python is sometimes called python3 on some linux distros. If it doesn't work to copy the commands as they are, you might need to take the 3 off.
```
pip install flask
git clone https://github.com/Josh-Reimer/Manual-Server
cd Manual-Server
python3 app.py
```
