Manual_Server is a simple web app built with python3 flask and pure javascript for managing all your pdf manuals.
What makes this app different than all the gazillions of other self-hosted apps? It doesn't use a database! It uses the file system entirely! This is partially because I am unfamiliar with databases and also I wanted to be able to easily run this anywhere.
I might have to migrate to mysql or something sometime.

INSTALLATION

pip install flask

git clone https://github.com/Josh-Reimer/Manual-Server --depth 1 --branch=main ~/manual-server

 cd manual-server
 
 python app.py
